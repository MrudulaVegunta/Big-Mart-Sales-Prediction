• Predicted sales for the retail organization Big Mart based on data acquired from relevant store.

•	Cleaned and processed a dataset for prediction using R software.

•	Interpreted the model to understand properties of products which play key role in increasing sales.

•	Feature engineered to read and resolve the data parameters ambiguity.

•	Used advanced statistical techniques like linear regression, Lasso regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost to build models and applied cross validation on the training data to select the best parameters of the model.

•	Determined each model’s performance by comparing RMSE. XGBoost had the least RMSE among all the Machine Learning models built.
